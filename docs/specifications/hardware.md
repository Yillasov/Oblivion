# Hardware Integration Guide

This guide covers the integration of neuromorphic hardware platforms with the Oblivion SDK for UCAV development.

## Supported Platforms

### Intel Loihi
- Neuromorphic research chip
- Spiking neural network architecture
- Low power consumption

### SpiNNaker
- Many-core neuromorphic platform
- Real-time neural simulation
- Scalable architecture

### IBM TrueNorth
- Digital neurosynaptic core
- Event-driven parallel architecture
- Energy-efficient computing

## Hardware Setup

### Installation

1. Install hardware drivers:
```bash
# For Loihi
pip install intel-nx-sdk

# For SpiNNaker
pip install spinnaker-tools

# For TrueNorth
pip install truenorth-runtime
```

2. Configure hardware settings in `configs/[platform]/config.yaml`:
```yaml
# Example for Loihi
loihi:
  connection:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 22222
  resources:
    cores: 128
    memory: "4G"
  optimization:
    power_mode: "efficient"
```

### Verification

Test your hardware connection:
```python
from oblivion.hardware import HardwareManager

# Initialize hardware manager
hw_manager = HardwareManager()

# Test connection
status = hw_manager.test_connection()
print(f"Hardware Status: {status}")
```

## Neural Network Deployment

### Model Preparation

1. Convert your neural model to the target platform format:
```python
from oblivion.neuromorphic import ModelConverter

# Load your trained model
model = NeuralNetwork.load_model('my_flight_controller')

# Convert for target hardware
converter = ModelConverter(target='loihi')
converted_model = converter.convert(model)
```

2. Deploy to hardware:
```python
from oblivion.deployment import HardwareDeployer

# Initialize deployer
deployer = HardwareDeployer()

# Deploy model
deployment_id = deployer.deploy(converted_model)
```

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Management

- Optimize neural network architecture for hardware constraints
- Monitor memory usage during operation
- Implement efficient spike encoding schemes

### Power Efficiency

- Use power-saving modes when appropriate
- Monitor temperature and power consumption
- Implement dynamic power management

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Connection Failures
- Check physical connections
- Verify network settings
- Ensure proper driver installation

2. Performance Issues
- Monitor resource usage
- Check for memory leaks
- Verify timing constraints

3. Model Compatibility
- Ensure model format matches hardware
- Verify resource requirements
- Check for unsupported operations

## Best Practices

1. Hardware Management
- Regular maintenance checks
- Proper cooling and ventilation
- Backup power solutions

2. Development Workflow
- Test on simulation before hardware
- Implement gradual deployment
- Maintain version control

3. Security
- Implement access controls
- Regular security updates
- Monitor system logs
