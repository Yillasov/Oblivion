# Getting Started with Oblivion SDK

This guide will help you get up and running with the Oblivion SDK for developing Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) with neuromorphic computing capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.8
- Compatible neuromorphic hardware (Loihi, SpiNNaker, or TrueNorth)
- Basic understanding of UCAV systems and neural networks

## Installation

```bash
pip install oblivion-sdk
```

## Basic Setup

1. Import the necessary modules:

```python
from oblivion.simulation import Environment
from oblivion.control import FlightController
from oblivion.neuromorphic import NeuralNetwork
```

2. Initialize the simulation environment:

```python
env = Environment()
controller = FlightController()
neural_net = NeuralNetwork()
```

## Your First Simulation

1. Create a basic flight scenario:

```python
scenario = env.create_scenario({
    'altitude': 1000,  # meters
    'speed': 200,      # km/h
    'weather': 'clear'
})
```

2. Configure the neural controller:

```python
neural_net.load_model('basic_flight')
controller.attach_neural_network(neural_net)
```

3. Run the simulation:

```python
env.run_simulation(scenario, controller)
```

## Next Steps

- Explore more complex scenarios in the [Examples](../examples/)
- Learn about hardware integration in the [Hardware Setup Guide](hardware_setup.md)
- Understand neuromorphic computing integration in the [Neural Integration Guide](neural_integration.md)

## Common Issues

### Hardware Connection
If you encounter issues connecting to neuromorphic hardware:
1. Check hardware power and connections
2. Verify driver installation
3. Ensure correct configuration in `configs/[platform]/config.yaml`

### Simulation Errors
For simulation-related issues:
1. Verify scenario parameters are within acceptable ranges
2. Check system requirements are met
3. Review logs in the `logs/` directory
